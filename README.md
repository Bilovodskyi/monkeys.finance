# Monkeys Finance

Monkeys Finance is a crypto trading platform built for people who want automation without staring at charts all day.

It helps you:
- track trading signals generated by our strategies,
- filter low-quality signals using machine learning,
- receive real-time notifications,
- and optionally automate trade execution on supported exchanges.

## How it works

1) **Market data**
We continuously monitor crypto markets.

2) **Signals**
Our strategies generate trading signals based on market conditions.

3) **ML validation**
Signals are checked by machine learning models to reduce noise and filter weaker setups.

4) **Your choice: alerts or automation**
- **Notifications:** connect a provider (e.g., Telegram) to get alerts when signals happen.
- **Automated execution:** connect a supported crypto exchange so the bot can open and close positions automatically based on your settings.

## What you can do in the app

- Explore available strategies and instruments
- Review backtests (simulated performance)
- Create and manage cloud instances that run 24/7
- Connect notification providers for real-time updates
- Connect exchange API keys to enable automated execution
- View trade history and performance stats

## Important notes

- Trading involves risk. Automated trading and leverage can increase losses.
- Backtests and performance charts are simulated/hypothetical and don’t guarantee future results.
- You are responsible for your exchange settings, risk limits, and monitoring your account.

## Repository scope

This repository contains the Monkeys Finance web application (frontend + API routes).
The core strategy logic, ML training, and automation pipelines are maintained in private repositories.
